# Build your own Deep Learning powered Screen Damage Detection App
This repo contains the code needed to build an Android app that interact with a [Nanonets'](https://nanonets.com/ custom model through an API.

## The App
The featured app is an Android app where a user takes images of mobile phones, and communicates to the model through Nanonets API, to tell whether the screen is damaged or not.

## The model
The model is question is a "mobile screen damage detection," a classifier that predicts whether the images taken are of a "normal" phone or one with a broken screen.
This model has been completely trained on Nanonets, and hosted there.

## Requirements
Android Studio and the Android SDK

## Instructions
To build the project, first clone the repo. Then open Android Studio, and on the splash screen, click on  "Open an existing Android Studio project" and selected the cloned directory.
Once the project is opened, click on the green "Play" button to launch it either on a simulator or a real device (if one is connected to the computer).

## Tutorial
For the complete tutorial, and a step-by-step explanation on how to build a custom model using Nanonets, please refer to the complete tutorial at this link:... 

This is the app in action.
